# StarStash

### How To Play StarStash

- Use the arrow keys to move from side to side.
- Collide with a star to collect or "stash" it.
- Collect as many stars as you can without missing any.
- Once you miss three stars, you run out of lives and the game ends.
- Press space to play again.

### About The Game

'StarStash' was developed for AppalHack, a 24-hour university Hackathon sponsored by Camelot 3PL Software, iRODS, ECRS, and JSA. This was my first ever coding project after switching my major to Computer Science, and implements my newfound Python skills along with my history as an artist. I used the Pygame library to create the GUI for the game, learning the functions and syntax of a new library within a short time period. I earned "Best Beginner Hack", the first place reward for Beginner Programmers (those who have yet to take Computer Science II), for my efforts and execution.
